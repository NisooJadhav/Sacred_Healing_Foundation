🌿 My Reiki Healing Experience (Founder’s Journey) 🌿 : 

“Reiki has completely transformed my life on every level — emotionally, physically, mentally, spiritually, and even financially. When I first stepped into my Reiki healing journey, I was simply searching for inner peace and emotional relief. But Reiki gave me far more than I had ever imagined.

During my healing practice, I began experiencing deep emotional balance and mental clarity. Slowly, layers of fear, anxiety, stress, and overthinking started dissolving. I became more calm, centered, confident, and emotionally stable. My reactions to situations changed, my decision-making improved, and I started feeling more aligned with myself.

One of the most powerful and visible shifts I witnessed was in my financial condition. As my energy healed and aligned, my mindset around money changed. Gradually, my business started growing, new opportunities appeared effortlessly, client flow improved, and abundance began flowing naturally into my life. Reiki helped me remove financial blockages and develop a positive, abundant outlook.

Health-wise, Reiki worked like a true blessing for me. My childhood sinus problem, which I had been carrying for years, completely healed. Additionally, my 4–5 year old migraine issues reduced gradually and finally disappeared. Along with physical healing, my sleep cycle improved, body fatigue reduced, and I started feeling more energetic and lighter from within.

Reiki also strengthened my intuition and inner guidance. I became more aware of energies, more connected to my higher self, and more protected energetically. My relationships improved as emotional wounds healed, communication became smoother, and inner peace reflected in my outer world.

Reiki didn’t just heal my symptoms — it healed my root causes. It aligned my mind, body, and soul, bringing balance, protection, clarity, and purpose into my life. This powerful transformation inspired me to walk on the path of healing and help others heal, grow, release blockages, and transform their lives through Reiki and energy healing.”
